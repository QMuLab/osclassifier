A named list with 4 elements. Each element is a character vector of gene symbols.

\description{
A named list of curated gene sets representing four osteosarcoma molecular subtypes:
\itemize{
\item Proliferating-like
\item Osteoblast-like
\item Chondroblast-like
\item Fibroblast-like
}
}
\details{
These gene sets are used by \code{classify_plot_modules()} to compute module scores and assign samples to the most representative subtype.
Genes were derived from consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) analysis, capturing subtype-specific expression programs.
